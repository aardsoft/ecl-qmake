** Introduction

This is a qmake extension to compile lisp files with [[https://common-lisp.net/project/ecl/][ecl]] and later [[https://gitlab.com/eql/EQL5][eql5]] from inside a qmake project.

A simple configuration to compile a static library from just =core-init.lisp=, loading =EQL5-symbols.lisp= and =asdf= for the compilation would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
CONFIG += ecl
TARGET = core_init_lib
ECL_SOURCES = core-init.lisp
ECL_LOAD = EQL5-symbols.lisp
ECL_EVAL = '(require :asdf)'
ECL_INIT_NAME = init_lib_CORE_INIT__ALL_SYSTEMS
#+END_SRC

To use this the =QMAKEPATH= variable needs to point to a directory named =mkspecs/features= containing the .prf files. The documentation in [[https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-advanced-usage.html][Advanced qmake]] is wrong, it doesn't search at the top of the project directory.

** Features

- [ ] use =QMAKE_CC=/=QMAKE_AR=/... variables to generate a compiler/linker configuration file
- [ ] add an eql profile with temporary scripts for compiling and linking
- [ ] allow file specific lisp eval
- [ ] allow multiple load files - due to load order adding them to eval isn't working
